# A Search Blueprint Backed List

Sample code for the Liferay DevCon 2021 presentation *"Creating Fully Custom Search Experiences With No Code"*.

__Notice:__ This code is to demonstrate how to call and consume Liferay Search Blueprints in custom modules. It won't however compile before the the Blueprints Gradle dependencies are  publicly available (within `release.dxp.api`).
